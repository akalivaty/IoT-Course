This project is simulating a smart parking system, which allows up to 3 car to be parked. The servo simulates the barrier gate, and the RGB LED indicates the parking status. The system is controlled by 2 photoresistors, which detect the presence of a car (one for entry and one for exit). The system is designed for a parking lot, where the barrier gate opens when a car is detected, and the parking status is indicated by the RGB LED.

LED condition:
- No light: no car inside
- Green light: 1 car inside
- Yellow light: 2 cars inside
- Red light: 3 cars inside

Required components:
- 1 Servo (SG90)
- 1 RGB LED
- 2 Photoresistors
