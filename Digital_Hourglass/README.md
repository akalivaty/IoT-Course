This project is an advanced exercise based on the arduino example, Digital Hourglass.

Leds light up sequentially when short clicking the button.
Example steps:
1. All leds light off initially
2. Click the button once, the first led lights up
3. Click the button again, the first and the second leds light up
4. Click the button seven times and all the leds light up

If the button is pressed for more than 1 second, the leds light off back sequentially (interval is 500ms). Finally, the buzzer beeps twice.
